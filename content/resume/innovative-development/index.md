- Implemented a Selenium Grid on Windows 2012 and Windows 2008 server VMs, developed a Powershell script to kill any orphaned Webdriver processes on the host and restart the Hub and Node prior to running the test suite.

## Reason for Leaving

Had the opportunity to be employed directly by a software company Nuix, rather than working as a contractor, which I felt would offer more stability and career growth.
