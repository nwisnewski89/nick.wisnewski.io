## Role Recap

Worked on the Nuix Web Review product team. Responsibilities included working with the development team and product owners to devleop test scenarios and test data for in sprint user story testing and regression scenarios. Advocated for a shift in QA methodology to develop automated test cases for each user story in the sprint where feasible, rather than grabbing from a backlog of manual regression scenarios. The shift was then adopted by other QA teams in the Conshohocken office. I was pivotal in scaling out and enhancing the <a href="https://gebish.org/" target="_blank">Geb</a> test automation suite. Specialized in installer testing and triaging customer issues.

## Accomplishments

* Transitioned the test suite from running a local webdriver to utilizing a shared Selenium Grid provisioned by the DevOps team.

* Developed logic in the test suite to execute Powershell or Bash scripts (depending on the application server OS) via SSH to enhance the UI testing of the Configuration application.

* Developed API utility classes to set up different UI testing scenarios.

* Coached other team members to become contributors to the test automation suite and following the new practice of developing automated test cases in sprint we scaled out from ~60 - ~500 test cases.

* Developed a Jenkins job to run the test suite nightly.

## Reason for Leaving

The opportunity presented by Linode was very intriguing, desired to work with different technology stacks.
